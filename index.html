                With HTML, web developers can define the headings, 
                paragraphs, lists, images, links, and other elements 
                that make up the content of a web page. They can also 
                create forms for user input, embed multimedia content like 
                videos and audio, and add 
                semantic elements for accessibility and search engine 
                optimization

            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>The primary function of CSS is to define the styling and 
                layout of web pages, making them more visually appealing, 
                user-friendly, and accessible. CSS provides a way to define 
                and apply styles consistently across all pages of a website, making it easier for 
                developers to maintain and update their designs.</p>
